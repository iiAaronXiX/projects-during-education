# projects-during-education
These are projects that I have worked on during my time at university.

The artefact folder contains an Inventory Management System that was created for the use of The Entertainer Ltd. The program is not complete as of yet however it does allow the user to manipulate a database file.

The RRAS is a program that has been created for the NHS, specifically the University Hospital in Milton Keynes. The program was completed in time for the deadline and is ready to be handed over to the client.
